  </h1>

  <p className="mb-6">
    Nagpur, located in the central part of India in the state of Maharashtra, is one of the country’s most important cities both historically and economically. Often referred to as the <strong>"Orange City"</strong> due to its famous orange orchards, Nagpur is also considered the geographical center of India, with the <strong>Zero Mile Stone</strong> marking the exact center.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-6">
    As the third-largest city in Maharashtra after Mumbai and Pune, Nagpur is a major commercial and political hub in the Vidarbha region. It has rapidly developed over the years, becoming one of India’s fastest-growing urban areas. With wide roads, lush green spaces, and modern infrastructure, Nagpur is also recognized as one of the cleanest and greenest cities in India.
